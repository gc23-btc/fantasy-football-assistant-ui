# Project Status (Web App)

## Step 1 – Scaffolding

* Created a Next.js 14 application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
* Added `/api/health` route returning `{ ok: true }` for a basic health check.
* Added base project files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, Tailwind/PostCSS configs, global CSS, layout and page components).

## Step 2 – ESPN Fetch Layer

* Implemented `lib/espn.ts` with typed Zod schemas for leagues, teams, and scoreboards.
* Added helper functions `getLeague()` and `getScoreboard()` to call ESPN’s unofficial API with authentication cookies from environment variables.
* Added error handling for unauthorized responses and basic data transformation.

## Step 3 – API Routes

* Added `app/api/espn/league/route.ts` and `app/api/espn/scoreboard/route.ts` to proxy ESPN data.
* These routes accept query parameters (`leagueId`, `season`, `week`) and return parsed JSON.
* Responses are cached for 60 seconds via `export const revalidate = 60`.

## Step 4 – Gemini Reasoning Endpoint

* Added `app/api/lineup/advice/route.ts` which accepts a POST request with roster and scoring info.
* It uses `@google/generative-ai` to call the Gemini 1.5 model with a system prompt instructing the AI to provide start/sit recommendations, cite key stats, list uncertainties, and give a concise plan.
* Outputs are returned as JSON; errors are handled gracefully.

## Step 5 – UI

* Replaced the default home page with an interactive dashboard (`app/page.tsx`).
* Added form inputs for league ID, team ID, week, and risk profile.
* Added buttons to fetch league summary, weekly scoreboard, and lineup advice.
* Displays league information, current matchups, and AI recommendations when available.

## Additional Updates

* Added path aliases to `tsconfig.json` for `@/lib`, `@/app`, and `@/components`.
* Added `.env.example` with placeholders for `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `ESPN_LEAGUE_ID`, `ESPN_SEASON`, `ESPN_S2`, and `ESPN_SWID`.
* Updated `README.md` with detailed instructions for local development, environment variables, API testing, and deployment on Vercel.

## Next Steps

* Implement client-side enhancements (loading states, error messages, better roster parsing).
* Add caching strategies and error boundaries in the UI.
* Expand AI advice endpoint to incorporate opponent data and more detailed outputs.
* Add integration tests for API routes.
